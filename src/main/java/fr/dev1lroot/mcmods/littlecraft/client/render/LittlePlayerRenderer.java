/*
    LittlePlayerRenderer
    ---------------------
    Client-side renderer responsible for visually adjusting players
    based on their LittleCraft state (Little or Adult). ‚ô°

    Function:
    - When a player is in ‚ÄúLittle Mode‚Äù, their entire model is scaled
      down to 0.5x using PoseStack.
    - The head is then scaled back up slightly to keep proportions
      cute and readable.
    - Adult players render normally at full scale (1.0x).

    Known Issue (unfixed):
    - Because we apply scaling directly via PoseStack, the player‚Äôs
      nameplate (nickname tag) becomes misaligned and deformed.
      This happens because the label inherits the same transformation
      matrix as the model. Currently, this is a known rendering bug
      that still needs a dedicated fix. üß∏

    Notes:
    - This class is CLIENT-SIDE ONLY (annotated with @OnlyIn(Dist.CLIENT)).
    - It does not affect hitboxes, physics, or interactions ‚Äî only visuals.
