/*
    LocalPlayerLittleMixin
    -----------------------
    This is a *client-only stub* made especially for singleplayer. â™¡

    In multiplayer, the "IsLittle" state is synchronized by the server,
    but in singleplayer there is no dedicated server to handle that.
    This mixin makes sure that LocalPlayer (the client-side player)
    can still access its own LittleCraft state correctly.

    Basically: itâ€™s a soft fallback, letting little players stay tiny
    and consistent in singleplayer worlds, without needing server sync. ðŸ§¸
