/*
    LittleDataSync
    ----------------
    This helper class listens to player lifecycle events to make sure
    LittleCraftâ€™s attributes are always correctly applied. â™¡

    Why it exists:
    - Even though LittleData is normally saved and loaded through mixins,
      there are rare moments (respawns, world reloads, death cloning)
      when the synced data might get lost or desynchronized.
    - These events act as a safety net â€” they reapply the playerâ€™s
      LittleCraft state right after those transitions.

    In other words:
    Itâ€™s like a gentle reminder for the world to remember whoâ€™s little,
    even if they just woke up from a respawn nap. ðŸ§¸

    Events handled:
    â€¢ PlayerEvent.Clone â€” when a player respawns after death or dimension change
      â†’ Copies data from the old entity to the new one
    â€¢ PlayerEvent.LoadFromFile â€” when a player is loaded from a world save
      â†’ Restores their Little mode and age from persistent data
