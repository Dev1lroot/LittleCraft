/*
    PlayerLittleMixin
    -----------------
    This mixin extends the base Player entity with extra
    LittleCraft attributes. ‚ô°

    It defines two synchronized data fields:
      - LITTLE: whether the player is currently in Little Mode
      - LITTLEAGE: a placeholder for age-related behavior
                   (feature still in development)

    These values are registered with sensible defaults:
      LITTLE = false (normal player)
      LITTLEAGE = 3 (temporary value for testing)

    The purpose of this mixin is to give the Player entity
    the ability to carry mod-specific state across both
    client and server, enabling consistent ‚ÄúLittle‚Äù behavior
    everywhere ‚Äî even after respawns or reconnects. üß∏
