# LittleCraft

**LittleCraft** is a lightweight NeoForge mod for **Minecraft 1.21.1**, created to bring **Agere** and **ABDL** elements into roleplay gameplay.

The mod currently adds these main features:
- **Little Mode** - players can shrink into a smaller "Little" form with reduced model size, hitbox, and camera height. Switching is done via commands.
- **Diaper** - can be worn for immersive roleplay. While equipped, it gradually **loses durability**, simulating **wetness or fullness** equal to the durability lost. Both the **player model** and the **item in inventory** visually update to reflect the diaper’s current state.
- **Diaper Change** - another player can **change your diaper** by holding a fresh Diaper item in hand and **right-clicking** on you.  
This feature enhances interactivity and roleplay immersion, especially on ABDL and Agere servers.

These features are especially useful for **ABDL** and **Agere** servers, where size differences and roleplay props matter.  

Future updates will expand customization, add more interactive items, and improve compatibility with community-driven features.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

LittleCraft supports both **Singleplayer** and **Multiplayer** environments.  
It uses two player-specific NBT tags:

| Tag | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `IsLittle` | `boolean` | Indicates whether the player is in Little Mode. |
| `LittleAge` | `int` | Reserved for future features involving gradual scaling. |

These tags are saved in the player’s data and synchronized between client and server.
