/*
    PlayerPersistentLittleMixin
    ----------------------------
    This mixin handles saving and loading LittleCraft data
    into the player‚Äôs save file. ‚ô°

    Purpose:
    - Ensures that ‚ÄúLittle Mode‚Äù and ‚ÄúLittle Age‚Äù are stored
      inside the world‚Äôs player data (NBT) when the game saves.
    - Restores those same values when the player joins or reloads
      their world, keeping everything consistent and cozy.

    In short:
    Without this, little players would forget who they are after
    every restart! This class makes sure they stay small and safe,
    even after naps (aka save/load cycles). üß∏

    Technical notes:
    - Data is stored inside a dedicated "Littlecraft" NBT compound.
    - Only runs on server or integrated singleplayer host.
